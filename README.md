# AtoB-QA-Assignment

# Prerequisites

Protractor is a Node.js program. To run, you will need to have Node.js installed. You will download Protractor package using npm, which comes with Node.js. Check the version of Node.js you have by running node --version. Then, check the compatibility notes in the Protractor README to make sure your version of Node.js is compatible with Protractor.

By default, Protractor uses the Jasmine test framework for its testing interface.

In this task I set up a test using a local standalone Selenium Server to control browsers. You will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to run the standalone Selenium Server. Check this by running java -version from the command line.
